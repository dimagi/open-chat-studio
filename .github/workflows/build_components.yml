      - name: Disable AppArmor
        # Ubuntu >= 23 has AppArmor enabled by default, which breaks Puppeteer.
        # See https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/12818 "No usable sandbox!"
        # this is taken from the solution used in Puppeteer's own CI: https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/pull/13196
        # The alternative is to pin Ubuntu 22 or to use aa-exec to disable AppArmor for commands that need Puppeteer.
        # This is also suggested by Chromium https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/security/apparmor-userns-restrictions.md
