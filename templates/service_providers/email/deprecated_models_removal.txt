Hello {{ team.name }} Admin,

Several deprecated LLM models have been removed from Open Chat Studio.

The following {{ model_count }} model{% if model_count != 1 %}s{% endif %} that were in use by your team have been removed:
{% for model_name in model_names %}
- {{ model_name }}
{% endfor %}

This affects the following resources in your team:
{% if chatbot_count > 0 %}
Chatbots ({{ chatbot_count }}):
{% for chatbot in chatbots %}
- {{ chatbot.name }}{% if chatbot.nodes %} (affected nodes: {{ chatbot.nodes|join:", " }}){% endif %}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}
{% if pipeline_count > 0 %}
Pipelines ({{ pipeline_count }}):
{% for pipeline in pipelines %}
- {{ pipeline.name }} (affected nodes: {{ pipeline.nodes|join:", " }})
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}
{% if assistant_count > 0 %}
Assistants ({{ assistant_count }}):
{% for assistant_name in assistant_names %}
- {{ assistant_name }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

These resources have been updated to no longer reference the removed models. You will need to reconfigure them with a currently supported model before they can be used.

To update your resources:
1. Navigate to each affected chatbot, pipeline, or assistant
2. Select a new LLM provider and model from the available options
3. Save your changes

Best regards,
The Open Chat Studio Team
