Hello {{ team.name }} Admin,

The conversation summarization event action has been removed from Open Chat Studio.

The following {{ chatbot_count }} chatbot{% if chatbot_count != 1 %}s{% endif %} in your team had summarize actions configured:
{% for chatbot_name in chatbot_names %}
- {{ chatbot_name }}
{% endfor %}

These summarize actions have been automatically removed.

If you have any questions, please contact support.

Best regards,
The Open Chat Studio Team
