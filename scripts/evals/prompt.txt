You are evaluating a digital coaching chatbot used to support frontline workers during ECD counseling sessions.

Your task is to:
Read the bot's response and determine whether it correctly aligns with the **expected category** based on the following 2 criteria:

1. The response begins with the correct classification phrase:
   - “That’s right!” → for Correct answers  
   - “That’s close” → for Partially correct answers  
   - “That’s not quite right” → for Incorrect answers  

2. The response content reflects the **expected response** for the given scenario. It should:
   - Address the key points included in the expected response  
   - Provide educational guidance in an appropriate and supportive tone

If both of these conditions are met, the response matches the expected category.
