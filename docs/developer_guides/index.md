# Developer Guides

These guides are divided into two groups:

**Process Guides**

These are intended to inform developers how certain processes within the core OCS team work.

**Code Systems**

Each of these guides relates to a specific subsystem / subcomponent of the OCS codebase. These documents are intended as documentation for the given subsystem.

In addition to the documents in this section, you may also find the [OCS DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/dimagi/open-chat-studio) useful.
